## Educating young students in remote areas of India

**Recognition:** Named #1 on UW-Madison's yearly CS newsletter.

Taught basics of Computer Science to kids in rural and remote areas of India. Had to use examples from their day-to-day life for them to relate and understand. Most of the students had little to no knowledge of Computer Science so I tried to start from the very basics. I related the process of developing a software to that of baking a cake where the ingredients used in the cake were the inputs, the recipe was the algorithm, and the final result (the cake) was the software. The heating area of the oven was to be treated as the compiler, the buttons to control the oven represented an editor, and the oven as a whole represented an IDE.
