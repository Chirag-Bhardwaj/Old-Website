### Some Features:

### 1. All the coins are generated using a combination of the coin name and the previous coin's hashcode.

This makes sure that the coins are chained and each new coin is linked to the previous one.

### 2. All the coins use SHA-256 for generating hashcode.

SHA-256 protocol helps create a secure means for the coin's transaction.

### 3. All the coins are verified by the vault using the code. 

This verification helps the user verify that they have a legitimate coin.
