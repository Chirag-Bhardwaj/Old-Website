## Chirag-Coin

**Project description:** A simple and secure blockchain using the SHA-256 protocol. It can be used to create, mine, and verify your personal "crypto" coin. It uses the previous coin's hash, the previous coin's data, and the current timestamp (accurate to the millisecond) for generating a new coin's

### Some Features:

### 1. All the coins are generated using a combination of the coin data, previous coin's hashcode, and the current timestamp accurate to the millisecond.

This makes sure that the coins are chained and each new coin is linked to the previous one.

### 2. All the coins use SHA-256 for generating hashcode.

SHA-256 protocol helps create a secure means for the coin's transaction.

### 3. All the coins are verified by the vault using the code. 

This verification helps the user verify that they have a legitimate coin.
