## Memory-Match Game

**Project description:** A fun to play Memory-Match game where the user has to make all the cards disappear by matching them.

### Some Rules:

### 1. All the cards are face down when starting the game.

This is to make sure that the user doesn't see the cards already. 

### 2. The cards flip if 2 non matching cards are selected.

This makes sure that the user is actually using their memory to play this game. It also makes the game just hard enough for it to be fun.

### 3. If cards match the cards are permanently flipped face up for the rest of the game. 

This makes sure that the user doesn't get confused about the cards that are already matched and the cards that still need to be matched.

### 4. The game ends after all the cards have been matched.

Once the user has matched all the cards the game ends.
