## People Counter in the Lab

**Project description:** A Machine Learning project that is being currently used in the university's CS building to provide live updates of the number of people in the lab. It identifies every human and increments the counter when they pass the prediction line and enter the lab. It also decrements the counter when someone leaves the lab.

**Motivation:** For the lab to be open there has to be at least 1 lab coordinator in the room. Many folks who visit the lab on a daily basis had to contact the assigned coordinators to figure out if the lab was open. Everyone who visits the lab has at one point had to face the problem of travelling all the way to the CS building only to find out that the Lab was closed. I decided to create a live counter of the people inside the lab to tackle this problem. The current number of people inside is also updated live on the lab's discord page.

### Features:

### 1. Live count of all the people inside the lab

This count is shown on the lab's discord page.

### 2. Increments and decremenents the count based on someone entering or leaving the lab.

Accurately identifies a human using Machine Learning.

### 3. Functionality to send an emergency email if people inside exceed over provided limit.

Helps in keeping the lab safe and secure.
